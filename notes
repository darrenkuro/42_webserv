kill still kills even though child process already exited

http parser doesnt handle whitespace correctly when parsing headers. I think.

Should implement signal to gracefully exit server with closing open fds.

Two request in the same buffer. How handle?

when multiple servers listen on the same address(port), bind would fail instead of ignore (it should probably work and use host to match which server it routes to)
